 Feature Based Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping
 
 On this scripts the goal is to simultaneously localise a moving robot and map the environment of discrete landmarks or obstacles that
 surround it. Here uncertainty is added at each step based on the motion of the robot leading to errors in the estimation of its new position
 and the errors caused by the sensors used to detect the surrounding obstacles.
