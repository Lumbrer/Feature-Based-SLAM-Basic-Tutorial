# Feature-Based-SLAM-Basic-Tutorial
Found pieces of this SLAM simple tutorial in Matlab and managed to modify and add the missing files in order to introduce the concepts of Localisation and Mapping in a 2D environment using a reduced number of Matlab files. Can easily be further modified by means of adding new features as obstacle avoidance based on proximity or route planning after Mapping.

The Files are separated in specific folders for Localisation, Mapping and SLAM. 

I believe the originals have been attributted to Professor P. Newman from Oxford University and hence I do not hold copyright for these. 

I am including this as a starting point for personal projects to built on it.
